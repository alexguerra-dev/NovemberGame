## Questions

- Should I hide scroll bars?
- How do I do footnotes in markdown?
  - Is this github flavored markdown?
    - Can I use emojis?
- Is there a relative line vscode extension?

Looks like I found the documentation for both the emojis :heart:
I am not sure if that is the way I want the emoji to be renderd :-1:

It might be ok.
